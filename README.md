## How to use it 
1. `$ git clone https://github.com/lunit-io/mmg-nia`  
2. `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` 
3. `$ cd data_preprocessing` and do data-preprocessing [here](https://github.com/lunit-io/mmg-model-nia/tree/master/data_preprocessing)
4. To train and test 5-fold cross validation, use `$ sh test.sh $GPU_ID $PICKLE_PATH $DATA_ROOT` \
e.g. `$ sh test.sh 0 data_preprocessing/db/shuffled_db.pkl /data/mmg/mg_nia`  
    - If you want to use many GPUs, input multiple numbers: `sh test.sh 0,1,2,3, ...`
5. `$ cat resnet34-5fold-result`
